This library or framework provides easy-to-use iOS [Swift](http://swift.org)
bindings for the [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org) C++ library. It is written in Swift
3 and contains a bundled stable iOS
[`libzmq.a`](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq) binary. It provides ZeroMQ's
low-level API along with an object-oriented API.

## What is ZeroMQ?

> ZeroMQ (also spelled Ã˜MQ, 0MQ or ZMQ) is a high-performance asynchronous
> messaging library, aimed at use in distributed or concurrent applications. It
> provides a message queue, but unlike message-oriented middleware, a ZeroMQ
> system can run without a dedicated message broker. The library's API is
> designed to resemble that of Berkeley sockets.

## Requirements

- iOS 9+
- Xcode 8.0+
- Swift 3.0+
- Bitcode-enabled Xcode project

## Usage

```swift
import SwiftyZeroMQ

let (major, minor, patch, versionString) = SwiftyZeroMQ.version
print("ZeroMQ library version is \(major).\(minor) with patch level .\(patch)")
print("ZeroMQ library version is \(versionString)")
print("SwiftyZeroMQ version is \(SwiftyZeroMQ.frameworkVersion)")

do {
    // Define a TCP endpoint along with the text that we are going to send/recv
    let endpoint         = "tcp://127.0.0.1:5555"
    let textToBeSent     = "Hello world from iOS"

    // Request socket
    let context          = try SwiftyZeroMQ.Context()
    let requestor        = try context.socket(.request)
    try requestor.connect(endpoint)

    // Reply socket
    let replier          = try context.socket(.reply)
    try replier.bind(endpoint)

    // Send it without waiting and check the reply on other socket
    try requestor.send(string: textToBeSent, options: .dontWait)
    let reply = try replier.recv()
    if reply == textToBeSent {
        print("Match")
    } else {
        print("Mismatch")
    }

} catch {
    print(error)
}
```
